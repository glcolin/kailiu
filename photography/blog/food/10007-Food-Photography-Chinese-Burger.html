	This time I was taking photography for a Chinese restaurant that specialize in Chinese burger or Taiwanese burger. It is simple, fast yet very delicious food. Very good choice for a quick lunch or snack.

<p>
	This time I used dark color background. My usual mind set when come to food photography is shooting with bright sunny day theme. I think that is what people associated with food. However this time the client request dark color background in order to emphasis on the food. I think the client is right. Take a look at the photo.

<p>	I am kind surprised with the result. I did not expect it come out this good. I use the lights on the street as the background. It works out nicely. Just to compare with shot take on bright color background. You can see it looks much dull. Not as 3D as the shot above.
