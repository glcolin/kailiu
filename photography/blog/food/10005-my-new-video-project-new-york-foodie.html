	My friend and I want to try something new. We want to create a food video channel. However we speak Chinese not English. So where does this idea come from?
</p>
<p>
	There are many youtubers doing food channel. but these people are American who speak English. I do not see many youtubers who speak Chinese doing food channel in New York. You might wonder why speak Chinese since it is America. The reason is that so many Chinese tourists travel to New York. and according to wikipedia, there are nearly 600,000 Chinese in New York. and I am sure that not include illegal Chinese immigrant. so the population of Chinese in New York is huge.</P>
<p>	One of the big trouble for Chinese people in New York is where to eat. So many restaurants here. I am telling you every time my friends and I hang out together, the most asked question is where to eat for dinner tonight? Let's say if there is a food channel that is for Chinese community. I believe it will be really beneficial for Chinese both residents and tourists.

	We have just made our first video. I want to make our video high quality. I spend whole day to edit. I even added subtitle. so both Chinese and American can watch it. Overall it is a success I think. All my friends like it. I shared the video on facebook. I only have 340 friends and I got 320 views now. Ok enough talking. Here is the video.</p>

Currently we are doing it for free. You just need to prepare food for us and maybe some introduction of the dishes. If you happen to see this blog and you have friends want to do it. Feel free to contact me. Thank you!.
