	<p>Ok, I only have two photos to demonstrate my point.</p>

	<p>Basically to use human subject to interact with food to stimulate people's appetite.</p>

	<p style="margin-top:10px;">When I post these two photos on my facebook. My friends love it. The photo makes them also want to try the food out. I think by present food photography this way, it feels interesting. It can grab people's attention, arouse their curiosity, more likely to stimulate their appetite. I am not saying we should only shoot food like this. I am saying if we can give variety, that is always good.</p>
	<p>Things need to be concerned.</p>
	<ol><li>Need good looking people, otherwise might give opposed effect...Make people lose appetite...</li>
		<li>Need good lighting. Those snapshot people took in the restaurant is not good. If you want use the photo for promoting your business, need good lighting.</li>
		<li>Hard to make the composition. Because we still take food photography, not a portrait shot, so need to emphasis mainly on the food not the people.</li></ol>
	<p>I have another photo. I think it is more on the portrait side rather than on the food side.</p>

	<p style="margin-top:10px;">Composition become more critical. That is one major challenge.</p>
	<p>Also we can choose a middle path. We can only show part of body, maybe not showing the face. For example, only showing a gesture, like hand grab a burger or sip a chocolate coffee. By showing gesture, adding movement to the static food photography, it should feel more interesting.</p>
