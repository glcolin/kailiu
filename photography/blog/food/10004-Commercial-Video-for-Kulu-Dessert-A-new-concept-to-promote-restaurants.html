	I would not say it is a totally new concept. We know there are hard AD and soft AD. In hard AD video, usually people say and describe their product in a best way to try to make you buy it. Soft AD video is more about arouse the mood. There might be no word describing the product. There product might be only appearing a few seconds in the video. But the video can arouse your mood to buy the product. Which is better? It is not easy to say here.
</p>
<p>
	The video I have filmed and going to show you here stretched the soft AD to another direction. The video is like a short film or a music video.</P>

	This project was one of my most exciting projects in the past. It was my great pleasure to collaborate with Kulu Dessert. We come up with this idea to film a short story (around 5 mins) to promote the dessert shop. The video might feels nothing to do with the business aspect. But indeed it attracted many people come to try its dessert. We share the video on social media. Friends and friends shared also. The client also streaming it on the big TV in the shop. It really stir up people's curiosity. OK enough talking. Let's see the video</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px;"> The taste of the video is very Asian. You might know Asian like those story of romantic, a bit sad yet sweet at end. One of my friend said to me she even cried while watching it. Unbelievable, right? You might feel a bit boring or slow. Actually I feel the pace is too slow in the beginning. I can change the editing to make it faster. but since the client is happy with the video. I leave it as final.</p>
<p>Overall we think this concept is successful. We used a very very different way to make a video to promote a shop. And this concept can be used on all type of business shop. restaurants, clothing store, entertainment venue and anything. The idea is the most important thing. Good story, keep it short, can be funny or serious, can be sad or happy.</p>
<p>A video like this 10 years ago might cost huge money. But thanks to the booming of digital video. It is a great era to try out new concept. A such video really do not need big budget. It is all about concept and idea. The owner of the Kulu dessert like embracing new idea. After we made the decision of making a such video, he created a poster saying casting stars. We shared the poster on many social media. And then we held a casting event at kulu dessert. That's how we choose the two main characters. They are not pro actors. You can see it in the video. But they are pretty and handsome. Asian like pretty face.</p>
<p>Being both the DP and cameraman, it is a bit of burden for me. But I like this challenge. Overall a great experience for me.</p>
