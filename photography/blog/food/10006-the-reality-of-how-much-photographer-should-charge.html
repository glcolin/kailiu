	Today I want talk about the business side of photography a bit. I am not a big name by any mean. But I have been in this field for 5 years now. I still have many to say. Hope new photographer can get some insight about this industry.
</p>
<p>
	Where should I start. I think the first fact every new photographer should know about this business is that we do not shoot everyday. I saw some research online before. The average number of gigs a professional full time freelance photographer have for a year is around 80. That is about 6-7 gigs per month. I started out thinking if I lower my price and get more gigs so I should still be able to survive. That is the biggest ignorance I had. The demanding is limited. Only certain number of people will get married. Only certain number of restaurant need photo for their brand new menu. Only certain number of companies need photo for their new website. Only certain number of events happening in a month. If you are a new photographer, you need figure this out now. There are only certain demand for photography. You can't say because I am cheap, can you hold two weddings? So you can get more photos. You can't say can you conduct one more event this month? because I am cheap you can hire me more often. You can not say can your website change photo every month? because I am cheap, you can hire me often. It is not like this. We need figure this out in the very beginning.

<p>	Yes, you can lower your price, to take other people's job. But at end you will find that you can not make a living. Then you either quit this industry or you start to raise your price. So how much should a photographer charge? Let's say you have 10 gigs per month. and you want to make a minimal $3000 a month as starter. Then you need charge at least $300 per gigs. and I am telling you 10 gigs per month is too ideal. some month is slow. you perhaps can only have 4-5 gigs. but anyway. and do you know most gigs only takes 2-4 hours. not every gigs is full day. so if you want to make $3000 a month. I would say you need charge at least $100 per hour. That sound crazy for most people right? $100/hour salary can only make $3000 a month? Yes, this is the reality of photographer. We do not shoot every day. We spend time doing post process as well.

	Freelance photographer is a self operated business. We need cost of doing business. We need to upgrade gears constantly. Our gears can break as well. I spend $500 last month to repair one of my lens. We also spend huge time doing marketing. We should also spend money doing advertising. Even with $3000 a month earning, the money we can use for ourself is kind limited. 
</p>
	
<p>Let's use food photographer as an example. The average rate for professional food photographer in New York I would say is around $1500-2500 per day. By hour that is at least $200 per an hour. I price my rate at around $100-150 an hour. Some people may think I charge too much. The reality is my rate is at the lower end.

craigslist is a good place to start out. But those $20-50/hour gigs will soon unable to support you. You will get tired mentally and physically. We all sometimes in our life doing free photography or for very low price. Whether it is for our personal interest or for future opportunity. It is fine. But we need make living. We have to raise the price. I would suggest new photographer gradually raise your price. Do not stuck at the very lower end too long. Then if you all the sudden raised your price too much, you need to rebuild your client base all over again.

Obviously how much money photographer should charge is subjective. It depends on how much money you want to make. Some people are happy with $4000/month. Some people want to make $10000/month. If you are happy with making less money, then charge less is fine. This article just want to bring up some reality to new photographer. By the way there is a very good article about this topic called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.roshsillars.com/2016/02/how-much-should-photographers-charge-in-2016/">How Much Should Photographers Charge In 2016?</a> It is very very helpful.
