<h2>Food Photography for Packaging: how to shoot subject on pure white background</h2>
<p class="editor">Posted by <a href="/" target="_blank">Food Photographer NYC</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on 3/17/2016</p>
	<p>A new food company is going to launch their noodle product. They hired me to photography for its packaging. The key of this type of food photography here is that the photo need to be on pure white background (255,255,255). So their designer can lay out everything in photoshop.</p>

	<p>There are two ways to do it. First approach is that you put food on white surface, light it and shoot. Then you key out the food from background in photoshop (We know if we do not light white background well, the white will come out gray). You can use pen tool to do it. This approach is a bit time consuming in post. but the benefit is that you have shadow information. so the designer can extract the shadow area. He can place both food and shadow at whatever background he wants.</p>
	<p>The second approach is to shoot the subject on pure white background at first place. So no need to do photoshop. The benefit is time saving. The drawback is no shadow information there. If the designer need shadow later on, he need to create it from scratch in photoshop.</p>
	<p>Since the client told me that the final result he wanted is pure white background without shadows. So I decided to use second approach.</p>
	<p>The basic principle is that you use transparent glass as surface. We call it Plexiglas, Acrylic Sheets or Lexan Sheet. Maybe it has other names. You put the subject on it. And then you lay white background on ground. You use light to light this white background. Since your shooting surface is transparent, it will become pure white and you still have your subject exposed correctly.</p>
	<p>Using other light for lighting the subject. You can see my Plexiglas glass has undergo a lot of abuse……</p>

	<p style="margin-top:10px;">Since my shooting surface is kind small. The light stand will be in the frame. As long as it does not touch the subject. It is a simple fix. Next time if you need to shoot larger subject, remember to bring a much bigger surface. Mine is definitely only good for very small subject.</p>

	<p style="margin-top:10px;">Things you need to pay attention. If you give too much light to the white background, your image will come out washed out because too much light bounce into your lens. Set the power right to the point the white just become (255,255,255). also if your background is very large. one light is not enough to evenly light it. You might need two lights at each side to light the white background.</p>
	<p>We also spend another day shooting ingredient. The procedure is the same.</p>
	<p>The final image of packaging looks great.</p>
