	<p>Have you wonder why those photos in cookbook and food magazine look so amazing? Yes the photographer and the chef are important. But that's not the whole ingredients to a beautiful food photography. An excellent food image need the help of art director. The art director has the eye to look for the right props, shooting surface, color harmony and many other things.</p>

	<p>Today I am giving you a bad example of how a food photography looks without props and wrong choice of shooting surface.</p>
	<p>I did this photoshoot 3 years ago. I am not going to mention the name of the restaurant since it is already closed now. Sad!</p>
	<p>Let me show you the result</p>

	<p style="margin-top:10px;">What is your immediate impression? Boring, right?</p>
	<p>The lighting looks good. but the photo does not look interesting. The reason is that there is no propping and styling. Also the color and texture of the table distract the food. It is not easy. There is psychology involved. what color, shape and size of props to use. How to place them along with the food. Props can be as simple as the plate. For example, the plates used in the photos above does not fit well for the photo. An art director or stylist can give suggestion on what plate to use.</p>
	<p>This was a big lessen for me back then. From this aspect, food photography is similar to fashion photography. If you want to create the best image. You need art director. Photographer is just one member of the team.</p>
	<p>My food photography improved a lot since the. Now I always ask the clients if they want to use any props, things like wooden surface, napkin, silverware, etc. Most of time we do not have budget for art director or stylist. I will just let the clients prepare for props if they wanted to use. We can still create some beautiful image on low budget. If clients does not want to go though those things. They just want me to come taking photo. Then at least I will prepare a few of placemats or table cloth in case their table looks really bad.</p>
