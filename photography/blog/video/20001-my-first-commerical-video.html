	This film was shot 2 years ago. This was my first time direct a commercial video. It is more like a short film. I have been doing video for events for long time. For events, I never really need to think any storyline and script. So this project was very challenge for me. I was not sure what is the procedure for filming a CV. I was also the DP and camera man. Pretty much I need to handle everything.
</p>
<p>
	After I wrote down the story, I translate every sentence to actual shot visually in my mind. This is the hardest part. And the most crucial part of making this film. If I can plan every shot in advance. the actual filming will be much organized and easier. People not in this filed do not know it. They think one can just come to set and direct every shot. It will be a big mess without preparation. The next step is to draw simple diagram for each shot on paper. I think I spend whole day to do this.
</p>
<p>
	The thing I learned mostly from this project is that one person can not handle everything. You can not be director, DP, camera operator, sound guy at once. It will only hurt the quality of your film. Now I understand why making a film need so much money. It is not an easy task. My friend said right. He said you can be lucky to capture an amazing photography, and call yourself a master. but you need budget and crew to make a great film, a great film is never a fluke.</P>
	
	
<p>
	The actual filming took one and half days. Half day at the airport. one day at the shop.</p>
	
<p>
	Camera used is Panasonic GH3 with 12-35 f2.8 and 35-100 f2.8 lens. Honestly GH3 is outdated 2 years later now. Now I use Sony a7s. The image will be more beautiful with a7s. The slider I was using is a low quality one. You will see a few of the slider shots in the video that looks kind wobbling. We used one LED light just for one scene. The scene where the male actor is in the backlight situation(from 3:50 mark). The LED light fill in a bit. </p>
	
<p>
	The scene on the airport is totally handheld. We found a spot where there was no security. So we could film there with ease.</p>
<p>
	The editing is relative simple. We shot everything in order. It is a matter of put everything together. and adjust the pace and mood of the film.
</p>
	
<p>I know it is not a big project. But it still took me total 4-5 days to do this project. I hope I can have more opportunities to do this kind of project in the future. And hope it can give some insight for people just start out. You are also very welcome to give suggestion and idea to my CV. Thank you!</p>
