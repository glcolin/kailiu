		<p>As part of determining the pricing method you wish to use to set your fees, you need to consider the available pricing options. There are various ways to charge for your your legal services ¨C hourly, contingent fee, fixed rate, or some alternative structure. The type of pricing appropriate for your practice will depend on a number of factors, including, the field in which you practice, the nature of the client's case, and the client's request for alternatives, if any. This article discusses hourly pricing.
Hourly rates are commonly used in the legal world to price legal services. The law firm model is generally based on the billable hour, that is, attorneys are accountable for, and charge clients, in one-sixth of an hour increments.  
This system has been much maligned in recent years as outdated and inefficient. Despite the criticism, however, the practice continues as the standard for many law firms.

		To begin the process of setting your hourly rate, you can compute the overall cost of running your practice and divide that amount by the number of projected or actual annual billable hours. This figure will give you a starting point upon which you can base your hourly rate. For an in-depth look at setting hourly rates in firms with multiple attorneys, see ABA's Law Practice Today article, Pricing Legal Services, by Ward Bower. - See more at: http://practice.findlaw.com/financing-a-law-firm/types-of-pricing-for-legal-services-hourly-billing.html#sthash.M3DsYVzL.dpuf

		Retainer fees are often used in conjunction with hourly billing to provide the attorney with security of payment, as the cost of hourly fees earned is deducted from the retainer fee. Requiring this type of retainer is allowed provided any unused portion is returned at the end of the representation. The amount of the retainer will depend on the type of case being undertaken, and the type of client.
Above all else, attorney fees must be reasonable and comply with your state's rules on fee arrangements. With regard to hourly billing, ABA Model Rule 1.5, Comment 5 specifically admonishes that attorneys not use "wasteful procedures."</p>
