		<h2>This page is devoted to my New York foodie project. All video were shoot and edit by Kai Liu Visual</h2>
		<p>There are so many many Chinese residents and tourists in New York. We want to know good restaurant for eat. But there is lack of information online for those Chinese people. My project is aiming at giving guide to Chinese people where to eat in New York. We speak Chinese in the video and I put English subtitle. So even American can watch my video.</p>
